    <p>in the early 20th century , several avant-garde movements , including the dadaists , surrealists , and futurists began to argue for an art that was random , jarring and illogical .</p>
    <p>under such premises , people can identify precursors and early examples of surreal humour at least since the 19th century , such as lewis carroll's alice's adventures in wonderland and through the looking-glass , which both use illogic and absurdity (hookah-smoking caterpillars , croquet matches using live flamingos as mallets , etc.) for humourous effect .</p>
    <p>a distinctly pythonesque strand of surrealism is prevalent in the work of stand-up comedian eddie izzard , who often uses anthropomorphic constructs in order to tell a running joke , often splicing several jokes together throughout a two-hour show .</p>
    <p>traditional comedy and drama can depend on the ritualization and predictability of human emotional experiences , where the theatre of the absurd uses disjunction and unpredictability .</p>
